================================

This repository contains the classes implemented for the GoEuro development test
Once the jar es created, you can execute it using the following command

java -jar JAR-FILE "CITY_NAME" [locale] [file_name]

To Be Implemented

As this is a test, there are severeal things pending to implement in order to convert this project to real one
- The unit tests and functional tests are missing
- I've used the System.out.print to show messages, a proper message logging is missing
- Configure url's or other properties using properties files
- Add some metrics in order to test the correct behaviour of the service
- Review the Exception handling
